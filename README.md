# PremiumMen E-commerce Website

A full-stack e-commerce website for selling premium vanilla products and men's underwear with integrated Payflowly payment processing.

## üö® Important Note About "Static" Deployment

**This is NOT a static website** - it's a full-stack application that requires both frontend and backend components to function properly. It cannot be deployed as a simple static page because it includes:

- Express.js backend server
- Payment processing with Payflowly API
- Order management system
- Database storage
- API endpoints

## üèóÔ∏è Application Architecture

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Vite build system
- **Backend**: Express.js server with REST API
- **Payment**: Payflowly integration for secure payments
- **Storage**: In-memory storage (can be upgraded to PostgreSQL)
- **UI**: shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS

## üöÄ Deployment Options

### Option 1: Replit Autoscale Deployment (Recommended)

Deploy directly from your Replit workspace for automatic scaling:

1. **Prepare for Deployment**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Create Deployment**:
   - Click the "Deploy" button in your Replit workspace
   - Choose "Autoscale Deployment"
   - Configure machine power (CPU/RAM) as needed
   - Set maximum scaling instances

3. **Environment Setup**:
   - Your Payflowly configuration is already included
   - The app will be accessible via a `.replit.app` domain

4. **Benefits**:
   - Automatic scaling based on traffic
   - Cost-effective (scales down to zero when idle)
   - Built-in monitoring and logs

### Option 2: Replit Reserved VM Deployment

For applications that need to stay always-on:

1. **Choose Reserved VM** when creating deployment
2. **Configure Resources**:
   - Set dedicated CPU and RAM
   - Choose always-on configuration
3. **Best For**:
   - High-traffic applications
   - Consistent performance requirements
   - Applications that need persistent connections
